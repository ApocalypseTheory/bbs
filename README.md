# BBS

I know what your thinking... a BBS in 2024? What?

Actually you are probably thinking what is a BBS

Well a BBS is how I first experienced the online world. I am just playing around with GOLang so decided to see how easy it would be to start setting up a Telnet server to act as one.

I am impressed so far... I am not sure how far I will take this project due to my limited free time. However, I think it is a fun learning experience.
